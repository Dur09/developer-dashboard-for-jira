First cron will execute  `archive-call` script to compress the log files  so the compression can happen in non-Prod environment as well.\r\n2.

Basically, cron sends emails when running a cronjob when the job itself writes to STDOUT and STDERR, so we need to redirect STDOUT / STDERR to /dev/null, so there isn't any output for cron to capture and send. Let's do that for every cronjob we have.\r\n\r\nFor any of the output from the scripts that we want to keep, we should modify the job scripts themselves to log to a file instead of logging to STDOUT / STDERR.\r\n\r\nThis might need to be the fix for the VSCRON team to be able to test emails in QA.\r\n","Custom field (CAN QA - Is the account set up in the National CAN Fields Table?)":"","Custom field (Impacted Customers)":"","Custom field (Maintenance Summary Line)":"Launch TBD - Advertiser TBD","Custom field (Litmus Test 4)":"","Custom field (Destination Port)":"","Custom field (Config Files)":"","Custom field (Why Didn't deploy Base pkg?)":"","Custom field (What is being monitored?

In the mean time, VSFS is okay for the purpose of holding the logs that are in between until we find a better place for it (be sure that they are compressed).\r\n","Custom field (Config Files)":"","Custom field (Destination Port)":"","Custom field (Litmus Test 4)":"","Custom field (PPV Steps)":"","Custom field (Why Didn't deploy Base pkg?)":"","Custom field (What is being monitored? )":"","Custom field (Last Ad Date)":"","Custom field (Days Live)":"","Custom field (Add Dependencies)":"[{\"id\":\"Netscaler Service Group Removal\",\"type\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"Remove Server Objects from Netscaler \",\"type\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"Confgen\",\"type\":\"todo\"},{\"id\":\"NFS\",\"type\":\"todo\"}]","Custom field (Team Ownership)":"","Sprint":"","Custom field (Planned Start Date)":"","Custom field (Work Estimate in Days)":"","Custom field (Minimum Payable Duration)":"","Custom field (Team Accountable)":"","Custom field (Is Monitor part of the deploy?)":"","Custom field (Jira Request Type)":"","Custom field (OPS Team)":"","Custom field (Support Type)":"","Custom field (Data Customer Wants)":"","Custom field (Known-Test)":"","Custom field (Rally Roadmap Item)":"","Custom field (Operating System)":"","Custom field (Development Impact Score)":"","Custom field (TTEngage)":"","Custom field (Database Size)":"","Custom field (Additional copy points for script development)":"","Custom field (Change Approval Type)":"","Custom field (Fallback Listing)":"","Custom field (Client Name)":"","Custom field (Distribution Channels (for creative))":"","Custom field (Salesforce Link)":"","Custom field (Recommended Hostname)":"","Custom field (Is Outage Required?)":"","Custom field (Change Impact)":"","Custom field (Call Duration Threshold)":"","Custom field (Monitor From:)":"","Custom field (Expected Delivery)":"","Custom field (Timeout Playfile Name)":"","Custom field (Roll-Back Strategy)":"","Outward issue link (Blocks)":"","Custom field (VM-Deploy Base Marchex Packages)":"","Custom field (Do you have question about the process and how to use Jira?)":"","Custom field (Ad Phone Number)":"","Custom field (Revenue-t)":"","Custom field (Task Estimate)":"","Custom field (Tools Effort)":"","Custom field (Number of Customers Impacted)":"","Project url":"","Custom field (TTFixMinutes)":"","Custom field (Expected Revenue -
